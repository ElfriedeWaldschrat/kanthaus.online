We need to do some general maintenance and renovation work on the house as well as material and tools to start projects.
If you feel like you have something from the list below (or similar) or know a company that wants to get rid of some material, please contact us.
We also take broken or slightly broken things, that are repairable.
They might even be used to teach others or learn how to repair things.
