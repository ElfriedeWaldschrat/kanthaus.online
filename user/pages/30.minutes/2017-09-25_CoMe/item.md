<!-- Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Have fun!

  - "Dear all, My name is Ollie Nathan and I am interested in your housing project. I will be joining you on Sunday or Monday next week. I wish to carry out a little bit of research with you. I hope to carry out 1:1 interviews followed by potentially 1 group interview. *each running for 15/20 minutes). I am interested in learning more about alternative housing and exposing the narratives of individuals involved. My experience thus far is mostly with co-ops. I hope that this work can contribute towards a spring board built up to inspire and strengthen others to start up similar projects like yours. The vision is to accelerate a movement towards equity and sharing. Info shared can be kept anonymous and I will be happy to talk in person about how the information will be shard and used. Feel free to take part, not take part, ask questions etc ;-) Thanks and see you soon, Ollie Nathan."

  - Proposal for Collective agreements changes:
    - **Power Hour** "We meet every Thursday at 10:00 to roughly prioritize and allocate communal cleaning tasks and then work on those tasks for the next hour. This is an addition to ordinary cleaning, not a replacement!" [Doug, Matthias]
    - **Coordination Meeting** "We meet every Monday at 10:00 (sharp) to distribute information, make plans and generally coordinate. The facilitator (appointed last meeting) is encouraged to remind people about the meeting, start it on time, moderate if necessary and ensure it doesn't go on past 11:00." [Doug, Wolfi]
