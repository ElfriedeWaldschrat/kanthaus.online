### Expectations
- synchronization for the bigger picture
- room planning /  what to do with K22 - now is a good time to work on it
- social planning/community/conflict resolution
- longterm legal structure
- getting clear/publishing what we want to achieve / the future of kanthaus
- getting foodsharing running better
- implement projects: freeshop, freecafÃ©

### freeshop
Janina is interested in implementing a freeshop in K22-1-2.
What to do with the furniture inside?

### cooking event
High momentum/motivation to do an event in the near future, don't take this away by focussing too much on other projects now
-> Can be combined with the freeshop (people who come to that event can be directed to the freeshop)
- plan to spread the idea/invitation in Leipzig


### more concrete room planning
- For freeshop, we need to free K22-1-2
  - furniture to K22-1-1, where tables and shelves go also into K20-1
- Redesign kitchen in K22-2-2 with dishwasher and new sink setup
