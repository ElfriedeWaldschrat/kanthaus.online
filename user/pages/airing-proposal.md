# Room ventilation proposal

Especially in winter, it is important to regularly feed fresh air into the buildings.

## Reasons
  - Air humidity rises, especially by cooking, burning gas, as well as being in a room.
  - Air quality decreases with oxygen being used up
  - Air quality decreases with dust/smell getting into the air

### Humidity
The most important factor is the humidity.
It is measurable as well as the only factor that could impose damage to the building itself.
Propane gas releases 1.65 kg of water when burning 1 kg.
Cooking a medium meal like 3 kg of potatoes uses approximately 100g of gas, so releasing a cup of water into the air in 30 minutes.
Additionally, when cooking, water is being heated and evaporated into the air.
When using a fitting lid, or even a pressure cooker, this amount is minimized.

People also release water into the air.
This ranges from 30 g/h (sleeping) up to 200 g/h (medium activities like cleaning) or even more (when doing sports).

### Damage from humidity
Humidity normally gets measured as a relative humidity in %.
Air can take a certain amount of water before it is fully saturated.
This depends on the temperature of the air.
For fully saturated air, the relative humidity is 100%.
That is also the point, where water starts to fall out on a surface.

| Temperature | Relative humidity | Amount of water in g/m³ |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 10 °C       | 100 %             | 9.39                    |
| 15 °C       | 100 %             | 12.82                   |
| 20 °C       | 100 %             | 17.28                   |
| 25 °C       | 100 %             | 23.03                   |
| 20 °C       | 60 %              | 10.37                   |
| 20 °C       | 40 %              |  6.91                   |

This table shows, that cooling air with 60% relative humidity from 20°C down to 10°C would rise the humidity to more than 100%, so it would fall out as water.

In a heated room, the walls, windows and areas around the windows are colder than the air inside.
Here we create the situation, that warm, humid air gets into contact with a cool surface: At spots, the relative humidity rises.

### Impact of cooking to room humidity
Let us take an example room of 4*3*2.5m³, so 30m³, like a normal, big kitchen.
It is in our small flat with another 2 of these rooms, so let us assume 100m³ total air volume that is connected together (e.g. the doors are open).
Let us assume, that we have it heated quite nice to 20°C. As it is winter, we have a humidity of 40%.
That means, we have an absolute humidity of 6.91g/m³ or 691g of water in the air of this room.
We now do a chopping event for an hour with 3 people, releasing 3*100g, so 300g of water into the room.
After that, we also cook our medium sized meal for 8 people who where sitting in the living room, using 150g of gas in another 60 minutes, releasing another 200g of water into the room.
The people sitting release another 5*2*30 = 300g of water, the choppers/cooks for the remaining hour another 3*50 = 150g of water.
By the end of the cooking, our room contains 691 g + 300 g + 200 g + 300 g + 150 g = 1641 g of water, which translates to 16.41g/m³.
That means, we have increased our relative humidity in the flat to 95%! 

## Room ventilation
When talking about room ventilation, the topic is actual air exchange.
This happens through different sources.
The measurement rate for this in buildings is the air exchange rate, measured in room volumes per hour.
Because of the flow of the air, when one room volume is exchanged that does not mean that all the air is exchanged.
There is an additional number, called ventilation efficiency.
This ranges from ~0 (tilted window, air flow does mostly not go through the room) up to 1 (air of the room is completely exchanged, e.g. when you blow cold air into the bottom of a room that has an exhaust at the ceiling).

### Passive ventilation
A building has openings like doors and windows that are never perfectly sealed.
Depending on the age of the building and on the wind and temperature difference (more exactly: pressure difference), the air exchange rate is between ~0 to 1 room volume per hour.
This means, that the volume of the whole building is exchanged in an hour (windy outside, old building with not so nice windows) or one to more days (modern building with modern windows on a calm day).
The efficiency of this ventilation is not too bad, as it is mostly a flow from one side of the building to the other.
Let us assume an exchange rate of 0.3 for our 100m³ flat, so we get 30m³ of fresh air and get rid of 30m³ of the used air in an hour.
Taking reduced efficiency into account (as well as some lazyness when doing maths) means, that it takes approximately 5-10 hours for the air to become normal again after cooking.
(Because of reduced efficiency resulting in mixing instead of direct exchange, we need to replace 2-4 times the air volume to get close to the humidity of before).

### Opening one window
When opening just one window in a room (fully), we get an air exchange rate of 0.3-4 per hour with a reduced efficiency (sources don't give numbers, but expect air mostly being mixed especially when you are 2-3m into the room from the window).
This means that we would need to ventilate our flat/kitchen up to 60 minutes after cooking (still requiring at least 4 times the air volume to get close to the normal humidity).

### Opening multiple windows
By opening multiple windows, an air flow from one side of the flat, ideally passing through exactly the to-be-ventilated areas, out to the other side of the flat is created.
The efficiency in the path of the air is 1 (because old air is moved out without being mixed) while the efficiency for air nearby reaches 1 as well (because of a high air speed, turbolations are so high, that the air around is basically "grabbed" and taken outside as well).
The air exchange rate here depends mostly on the wind and is up to 40 per hour.
A good measurement here is: Go to the side of the flat where the air goes out of the window.
If you feel the air getting almost as cold as on the inflowing air (e.g. outside temperature), the air exchange has been done completely.
This does not take more than 5 minutes, even on quite calm days.

## Summarized proposal



  - ventilate eating room/kitchen (pass-through) 0-30 minutes after cooking for 2-5 minutes (gas contains a lot of water, food/cooking releases some as well: 1kg Gas release 1.65 kg of water, cooking uses 100-500g/h)
  - ventilate used rooms (2+ people) pass-through for 1-5 minutes at least once a day, at latest when there is condensation on/around the window (people release a lot of water, 30-200g/h depending on activity)
  - ventilate used rooms (2+ people) pass-through for 1-5 minutes before going to bed (because room will be unused/temperature lowers after that, so now new water/more likely to be condensation)
