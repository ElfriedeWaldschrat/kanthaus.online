### Coordination Meeting
We meet on Mondays at or before 10:00 to distribute information, make plans and generally coordinate. All residents are recommended to join.

===

### Power Hour
We meet on Thursdays at 10:00 to briefly review, prioritize, allocate communal cleaning tasks before splitting up and cleaning for the next hour. This is an addition to ordinary cleaning, not a replacement. All residents are recommended to join.

### Visiting
Visitors are invited to chat about their experience with a couple of the Volunteers/Members after spending around ~7 days in the space. Visitors are expected to communicate to a Volunteer/Member whether they want to apply to become a [Volunteer](../constitution#5-volunteer) or re-apply to stay as a Visitor spending more than 14 days and less than 21 days in the space.

### Smoking
Please do not smoke at all within the buildings. If you smoke outside, please ensure that smoke does not come in through open doors or windows.

### Drinking
The space is not a bar: please do not come here with drinking as a primary purpose and be aware that alcohol consumption will not be considered as an excuse or justification of behavior. That said, individuals may responsibly consume alcohol in the space. Please contact a Volunteer or Member with concerns or questions regarding this topic.

### Accessibility
The space is not very accessible right now, making it generally unsuitable for individuals requiring additional support (e.g. blind, wheelchair user, etc.) Individuals requiring additional support are not restricted from coming, however we may not have the infrastructure or resources to make the visit enjoyable. Feel free to contact a Member or Volunteer to get an update on the current building status or for any other enquiry.

### Animals
The space is not very safe right now, making generally unsuitable for animals. Even if it was safe, animals are not necessarily welcome due to factors such as: allergic reactions, hair-shedding, defecation, damage to resources, biting and other undesirable behaviors. Potential animal residents will be considered on a case by case basis. Please contact a Member to discuss bringing an animal.
