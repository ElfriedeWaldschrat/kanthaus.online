The very first hackathon Kanthaus will host will benefit [foodsharing.de](https://foodsharing.de) of course!

Matthias is happy to invite developers, who want to work on the legacy PHP code with him. There will be focused work, saved food and a special atmosphere of community and everything is free of charge!

[Click here](https://yunity.org/en/events/2018-02-10-fsde-hackweek) for the more detailed invitation or [write us a mail](mailto:hello@kanthaus.online) if you're already decided to take part! ;)
