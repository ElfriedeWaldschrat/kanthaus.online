The Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (short: UAEM) campaign for global access to medication. Especially publicly funded research plays a key part in this. That's why UAEM wants to figure out how universities can make a useful contribution: Fair return on public investment.

At this semester's vision meeting the following vital questions will be addressed:
- What do we want?
- How do we achieve our goals?
- What kind of structure do we need to function properly and pleasantly as a group?
