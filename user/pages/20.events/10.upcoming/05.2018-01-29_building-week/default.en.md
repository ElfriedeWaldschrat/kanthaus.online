There's still a lot to do in Kanthaus and we have a lot of ideas for improvements!  
Be it building an extra room for our very own FoodShare-Point, improving the water system of the houses, redoing floors, making a shower stall from saved tiles or simply putting up curtains - there's plenty of projects. Do you have ideas of your own? We're happy to hear those, too!

===

So far we have [this pad](https://pad.systemli.org/p/buildingWeekPlanning) (in German language) for plannings regarding the building week. If you'd like to help out we'd be happy to receive [a mail](mailto:hello@kanthaus.online) with some information about the lenghth of your stay and what you'd like to work on.

**As always accomodation and food is completely free of charge!**
