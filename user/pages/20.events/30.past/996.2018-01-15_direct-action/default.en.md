### What is Direct Action and what is the training about?

- You think many things go wrong in the world? Yu feel helpless, because you often don‘t know how the better can be achieved or enforced? Environmental destruction, human rights violations in establishments of coercion and exploitation – so many things are happening each day, but barely anything makes it better? This Direct-Action-Training will help. Because we are not as helpless, powerless as it seems. To the contrary: there are many forms of action that we can learn and practice in order to defend ourselves and fight back more efficiently, in order to raise our voices louder and clearer or to get involved more politically: communication guerilla, hidden theater, precise blockades or occupations, intelligent interruption of operational sequences and much more. They create awareness and provide space for individual calls and visions. We will discuss concrete forms of action, sceen the legal frame and try out things. ++ [Click here](http://beautifultrouble.org/tactic/direct-action/) in case you want to have more information beforehand.  
- If you can not come to the movie screenings in Leipzig or Wurzen on Monday night you can also watch [the introductory film](https://youtu.be/cruXcOk1egw) by yourself, in order to have the same knowledge before the training.
- By the way: More events, trainings and talks to similar topics can be found on the webpages of [ProWe Saasen](http://www.projektwerkstatt.de/pwerk/saasen/termine.html), for example a court defence training from the 12.-14.1. in Chemnitz.
