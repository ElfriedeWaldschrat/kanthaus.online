The next [foodsharing.de](https://foodsharing.de) hackweek is due!

In the middle of February we invite all new and old members of the foodsharing development team to gather at Kanthaus! The refactoring will continue and the goal to make foodsharing.de a platform that is not only open source but also future-proof is still on. So come and join us to help us make the light at the end of the tunnel become brighter!

You only need to bring yourself, your laptop and whatever it is you can't live without. We provide spaces for working, sleeping, eating and socializing, saved food and drinks, a hot shower and even some clothes and toiletries if you prefer not to carry so much.

The first weekend will serve as a time for introduction, getting to know each other, distribution of tasks and formation of working groups. Over the week there will primarily be self-organized coding, spontaneous meetings and/or pair programming sessions. The second weekend will consist of talks about how the coding went and how it will continue, as well as about the deeper, more philosophical topic of what foodsharing is and what it could be - not only on the software side of things.
