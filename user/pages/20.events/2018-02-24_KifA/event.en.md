The grand finale of the foodsharing February comes with an invitation: Everyone who's interested shall come visit us at Kanthaus to feast with us!  
For this Saturday afternoon we will celebrate food and the pleasure it gives!

Do you know the recipe for an extraordinarily amazing cake?  
Do you know how to bake the best cookies?  
Do you want to share your homemade jam with others?  
Do you have a kind of tea at home that you don't ever drink?  
Did you accidentally buy decaf at some point?  
Then bring what you have!

Of course we will also prepare food, so that nobody needs to go home hungry!

**Start: 1pm, end: open**

We're looking forward to an afternoon full of coffee, tee, sweets and encounters!
