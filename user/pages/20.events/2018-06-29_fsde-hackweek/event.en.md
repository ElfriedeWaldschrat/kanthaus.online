The next [foodsharing.de](https://foodsharing.de) hackweek is due!

The first week of July coders and coderettes are invited to gather at Kanthaus to have a great time with PHP and the foodsharing tech team! The refactoring will continue and the goal to make foodsharing.de a platform that is not only open source but also future-proof is still on. So come and join us to help us move into the right direction!
