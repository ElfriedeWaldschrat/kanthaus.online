We are happy to welcome the board of the federal foodsharing e.V. at Kanthaus!

Foodsharing grows exponentially and as amazing as that is, it also comes with great challenges. Legal aspects like liability, data privacy and administrative procedures need clarification. And the general structure the foodsharing community, which normally identifies more like a movement, can take on in the future is also still unclear.

On top of that the next active steps in the fight against food waste need to be planned. In December, when foodsharing turned 5 years, 5 ambitious demands were addressed at German politics. How to progress this further now will surely be discussed as well.

Having the development and internationalization departments of foodsharing directly in-house anyways, we're certain to get new insights and exchanges in those fields, too.

So there's a lot to talk about and we are extremely happy that we can support the board tackling this with our infrastructure!
