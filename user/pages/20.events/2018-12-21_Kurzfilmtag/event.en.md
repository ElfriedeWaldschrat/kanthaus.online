Warning! Short Films!

The short film day originated 2011 in France and was called 'Le jour le plus court'.

Since 2012 it also takes place in Germany. It is coordinated by the 'AG Kurzfilm' of the 'Bundesverband Deutscher Kurzfilm' and already grew to be a noteworthy cultural happening in which more than 20 countries participate. Professor Monika Gütters, representative of the German government for culture and media, is patron to the event.

We offer different movie selections for two audiences – one for children and one for teens and adults. Stay tuned for more detailed info about times and movies!
