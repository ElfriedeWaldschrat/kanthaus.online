The [Humus-Festival](http://humus-festival.de) is a self-organized, explicitly sustainable and collaborative festival, where people come together to learn from each other and celebrate together. It first took place in 2016 and led to so much interest since that this year there's going to be two Humus Festivals: First in May in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania (Humus North-East) and secondly in August in Hesse (Humus South-West).

There is a lot to do still! That's why the orga crew of Humus North-East will mcome to Kanthaus for an extended weekend and do a lot of planning and preparing.
