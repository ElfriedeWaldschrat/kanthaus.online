The critical psychology Dresden has founded a new university group!

At a communal kick-off weekend we want to plan our actions, discuss on which topics to focus, get to know each other and much more.

For this, we need you!

Together we want to question if psychological research and therapy is really objective, how "mainstream psychology" stabilizes societal power structures – and how it impacts our everyday life. But we don't settle for the content, we also criticize the meta level of research, science and university.

During our kick-off weekend we aim to conceptualize ways and methods to make a psychology that is aware of power structures more visible in Dresden.

If you are interested in joining in, please contact us via mail: critpsydd@autistici.org – Please be aware that we have only limited spots available, thus we cannot guarantee a place for everyone. If your application is successful, you'll receive an affirmative answer.

If you cannot come to Kanthaus but still want to take part in the newfound critical psychology group's activities, just come to one of our upcoming meetings in the beginning of the semester. The dates will be published on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kritischepsy) and on [our blog](https://kritpsydd.noblogs.org/).
