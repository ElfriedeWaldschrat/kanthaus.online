The idea of foodsharing shall be spread around the globe!

===

We want to enable grassroots initiatives everywhere to build cooperations with stores, organize volunteers and save all the good food from being thrown away unnecessarily.

That's why we invite foodsavers and coders to support our work to...
- improve the open source pickup-management platform [Karrot](https://karrot.world)
- discuss possible features, spot and fix bugs in the software
- get different people of the global foodsaving movement to share thoughts and ideas
- push forward the translation of our knowledge library
- collect and refine material about all aspects of foodsaving
