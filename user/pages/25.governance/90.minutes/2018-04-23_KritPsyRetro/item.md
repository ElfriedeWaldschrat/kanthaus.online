# Retrospective on hosting die Kritische Psychologen

Date: 2018-04-23
Participants: Isabelle, Matthias, Tilmann, Doug, Laurina, Mrkvon
Facilitation/notes: Doug

Feelings: some felt a bit confused about the planning, but everyone enjoyed the event

Change:
- high usage of toilet paper/low adoption of hygiene bottle
- unfinished food and used plates lying around
- lots of personal plate washing/low plate reuse
- communication with the KritPsy group was done exclusively over phone, leading to confusion (e.g. that a group would come earlier to prepare the 22.)
- general introduction to kanthaus was not scheduled and then delayed
- not knowing moderators were coming and what relation they had to group
- not knowing clearly the aim of the group (i.e. group formation/building)
- no initial meeting to get to know people
- no simple document to let people know our costs

Repeat:
- cooking and eating together
- musical evening by fireside
- giving initial group the house tour and then they give the house tour to the rest
- hosting nice and interesting people
- feedback/appreciation round at the event end.
