<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!
-->

### 5. Schedule <!-- Question: do we really need this section anymore? We have the Nextcloud Calendar and this seems like unnecessary duplication, especially since it's likely that more events come up during the meeting. I would propose to change this section just for week-commitments, e.g. who is doing the food pickups? Facilitating the Share Event? Facilitating the next CoMe? Etc -->
(For waste collection see https://cloud.kanthaus.online/apps/calendar/ 'müll' calender, for food pickups see https://foodsharing.de )

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- getting a water counter for K22 costs ~200€. Alternatively, we just connect it to the K20 water system. - Nobody is unhappy to buy a counter.
- getting smoke detectors will always be ~10€/detector (with a 10 year battery). Matthias suggests getting https://www.pearl.de/a-NX5663-3111.shtml?vid=917&wa_id=40&wa_num=4114&utm_source=googleps&utm_medium=cpc&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI796k9uuH2wIVCmQZCh1AzAVZEAkYCCABEgI7vvD_BwE is we want some. -  Doug will check it out.
  - Doug convinced that alarms which are only photoelectric are better: https://wahigroup.com/Resources/Documents/Ion%20vs%20Photo%20Smoke%20Alarms%20WAHI%20Conference%20Slides%20031415.pdf
- please always put full teapots on the small cupboard that also holds the tea - that way people know easily how much ready-made tea there is
- We can have almost boiling water coming out of the tabs right now, pleeeeease be careful! Doug will make signs. Tilmann is thinking about putting a Mischbatterie and points out that the hot water system is extremely temporary anyways...
- Having duplications with the Calendar and this template is not good. Starting next week we'll omit the schedule and only record commitments.

### 7. Next facilitator
- forgotten... -.- If nobody volunteers until next week Janina will do it again.
