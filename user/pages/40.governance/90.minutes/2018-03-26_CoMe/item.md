### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, etc)
- Next weekend is Easter! Shall we hide and seek sweets in the garden? :3 - maybe on Sunday? see how it goes?
- The recycled water to flush the staircase toilets became awfully stinky. What can we do about this? (Improve water filtering, automate pump, empty_tank completely)
    - we discussed for sometime, no obvious solution was apparant, a few thoughts:
    - somehow split the dirtiest water off during the first part of the washing machine cycle
    - have a more hardcore filter
    - clean out the tank, and empty it out more
    - nick wonders if there is something (nice) you can add into it that will help
    - https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-private/issues/91

- Toilet k20-1# refills_very_slowly, should_be_improved
    - could just make it more known it almost has no flush
    - or replace a bit with another bit
    - 0# toilet refills fast, so make it do whatever that does!
    - https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-private/issues/92

- Hand washing station k20-0 # spills a lot of water. Especially newcomers (as on the weekend) don't care - floor is always wet. This is bad (longterm)
    - maybe just a larger (wider) bucket
    - also a bit higher up?
    - put some covering on the floor?
    - https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-private/issues/93

- André Rotter and the aged young Christians from Machern offered again that we should apply for their workcamp. They are quite experienced workers, since they do these camps for years already. Apparently they'd very much like to lend us the work power of ~20 people for a week in August and maybe do the same in 2019.
    - maybe they can build a sauna in the garden :)
    - tricky to work out how to co-ordinate them to do stuff

- Roadmap progress?
    - seems a bit wayward
    - doug made a pad before https://pad.systemli.org/p/gJjw8vMSAZOj
    - the minutes are https://kanthaus.online/governance/minutes/2018-03-05_roadmap
    - Janina will create a bunch of GitLab issues

- Workshop_is_quite_unclean, should_be_improved
    - Tilmann is interested to sort this at the next power hour

- composting
    - adam had looked at adding cardboard/paper (squirt with water/washing up liquid to soften first), also kept moist, missing oyxgen for the lower layers
    - it's also getting quite full
    - idea for next one to put it next to sheds, can compost inside, need to turn it around a bit, maybe have smaller ones, need greens/browns not just food scraps
    - new one should not touch the walls of the 18 shed/garage behind

### 7. Next facilitator
Janina will gladly do it if someone else can read the counters... :3 (tilmann will do it!)
