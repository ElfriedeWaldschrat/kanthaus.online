<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- Task: 2 coats of white paint on window frame, any takers? -> maybe combine with other windows that need it?
- Request: calendar users please include link or brief description for events. (Doug)
- Question: when is the 1st Kanthaus Birthday? First residence record was on 2017-07-19, association of formal Kanthaus community 2017-08-05. (Doug)
  - We got keys on 2018-07-12, everyone happy with this date.
- Proposal: set up sharing event defaults
  - Default time: 17:00 - 18:00, Wednesdays. (Reasoning: far enough from Monday for reflection, doesn't clash with Landgut Nemt or regular events, allows 'community week' to end after the power hour)
  - Default room: cloud room. (Reasoning: comfy, calm)
  - Default format: 
    - 2-3 minutes silence
    - one round where people briefly share just their emotions (e.g. with explicit words, or metaphors: not reasons, solutions, etc)
    - 'open' circle until time runs out
  - Default norms:
    - If you're late and the door is closed, the group have started. Please don't disturb them, come earlier next time!
    - Please leave your phone outside.
    - You can bring your own cup of tea or glass of water, but please don't bring food.
    - Find facilitator at Come if possible.
- Stasi bunker in Machern can be visited any last weekend in the month (5/4€) (matthias) -> can be visited during the rotterparty for free
- Plan the financial meeting (8 hours -> 1/2 days) (Matthias)
- Kollektivhaus information round (Matthias)
- Look again at the spring roadmap meeting minutes (Tilmann)
- Adam requests help to complete the medicine inventory by including what the medicines are for, requests help of a German speaker. Some concerned that system is too complex. Adam happy to continue.
