<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Have fun!

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- in K20-0# there was two times the toilet-paper empty and the last person didnt refill it.. Only stupid toilet-paper-users here :( - Renewed awareness, include in the house tour and more witch-hunting should be an appropriate solution.
- Bufdi meeting outcome presentation and proposal announcement to be decided probably at the coming CoMe so people have time to think about it (Bodhi, Matthias, Laurina) - Look into Slack for more details.
- The feature by Jörg Wunderlich is in production now! :-) who would go on June 30? - Still unclarity about what exactly is the event. Janina and Matthias are generally interested. We wait for more info from Jörg.
- Kanthaus blog presentation of what is there and proposal (Janina and Laurina) - Weekly posts are the goal! The content can range from explanations of how to build things, documentation of projects, cooking, foodsaving, gardening to nice and pleasant slice-of-life pieces. The more Kanthausers participate the better!
- Vika/Guido-situation from the weekend: update and proposal for collective agreements - Ongoing talk in #kanthaus-governance, a general meeting about stranger responsibility and related topics will follow next week.
- Benji will spend quite some time (120h) here wanting to do productive work. Ideas? - Matthias, Tilmann and Bodhi will discuss the hipster room possibilities directly after this meeting.
- Planning for the next foodsharing.de hackweek should start soon. Then we can get funding for it again, maybe? - More about this next week.
- Do we want to schedule a meeting for me to tell people about how things have played out with the Noomap team. It is a bit involved and I only want to explain this once. (Adam) - Yep, on Friday.
- For your Information - at 1pm I will be having a call with British-Asian investigative journalist Nafeez Ahmed which is exciting! (Adam)
