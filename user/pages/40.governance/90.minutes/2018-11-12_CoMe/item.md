<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 6. Food planning

### 7. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- Und Jetzt meeting 7.-9. Dezember 2018 (matthias) -> it is fine
- Between Saturday, 22.00 and Sunday, 07.30 money out of the Move meeting money pot disappeared. This is a big breach of trust.
- Ablagevertrag: Contract with the post to allow them putting packages into our house is possible. We could do the contract online for some recipients and give a house key to the post woman so she puts packages into the hallway. No concerns to the round, but a suggestion that a NFC door opening system would make this easier.
- heating 1: How do we manage ourselves better? (communal closet heating was turned on yesterday) -> Turning off radiators that are in rooms we don't want to use (like communal wardrobe); putting signs in private rooms
- heating 2: Planning for next week (silent office and living room will be heated)
- there kind of was the request to bring children here instead of kindergarten. The CoMe round felt like we are not a kindergarten.
- Clara posted a list of things she has in Leipzig in slack and asks about opinions on bringing that here. We are likely going to Leipzig with the car in last november week or first december week.
- Isabel is interested in hosting a clothes repair session towards the end of the week. People who want to participate should speak to her. Fausto, Joe, Thore, and Clara are interested.

### 8. For next week
- suggestion: Schedule an extra sharing event for the internal one and not replacing the regular one to not separate the groups
