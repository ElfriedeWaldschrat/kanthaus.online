### Meta
- The house is like a ship: we can change sections at a time, but not all at once (without sinking). In practical terms, this means physically changing as few rooms as possible at a time, and at least preserving all necessary functions at all times (e.g. cooking, eating, sleeping, non-house work).
- Plans will change. Perhaps best to review after every room change?
- Jasmine has experience with an ABCDE method for planning and work allocation used in architecture. Doug and Janina interested.
- Jasmine suggests people to observe how much time they spend in rooms, which rooms they use in the day or night, which way the sunlight hits the building and when, etc.
- Everyone (?) OK to start dependency chain from kitchen location.

### Current problems
- **Primary: eating room too small for more than 10 people.**
- Secondary:
  - The kitchen is sometimes very crowded.
  - The dry food storage is far away from the kitchen.
  - Too much stuff in the dragon room makes it unusable as seminar room.
  - No designated space for arts & crafts.
  - Not enough space/storage in the workshop.
  - Not enough storage for visitor backpacks when big groups come.
  - Food gets forgotten in washing room.

### Current missed opportunities
- K22 is not used much.
- The biggest rooms we have are the least used.
- Freeshop zone is empty and no progress being made.

### Potential concerns about room plans
- Eating in public sight on ground floor could be annoying.
- Having focus areas on ground floor which are generally more public contradicts (esp. when doorbell rings).
- Multiple kitchens / eating areas require duplication of certain storage areas (tea, bread, cutlery, etc).
- Multiple workshops share a set of tools, so they shouldn't be too far apart.
- Having buildings divided into working and living, and that the working building is very quiet and the living one very busy..

### Significant missing information
- Can we connect the two buildings? If yes, how?
  - It will cost €500 to start the process.
  - We won't know before spring next year earliest.
- Roof action...
  - Meeting tomorrow :)
- How we get more €€€?

### Next actions
- Make upper office door openable when groups are here, so it can be used as stretch eating space.
- Schedule another meeting for after MOVE meeting (i.e. after 11th Nov).
- Try eating in cloud room/dragon room to experience 'public' eating.
- Update the [gitlab issue about kitchen location](https://gitlab.com/kanthaus/kanthaus-public/issues/149) and continue the discussion there
