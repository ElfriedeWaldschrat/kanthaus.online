Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 6. Food planning
- Potatoes and onions in the basement need to be prepared or given away.

- Alex will think of something with onions.
- Mikel will go through the veggies and sort out bad stuff.
- Matthias cooks a Sunday meal.

### 7. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- Hallway should get emptied today, and dragon room within the next days. - Bodhi will take care of the hallway. There are blankets in the dragon room, which have been clean but then on the / near to the floor and thus are not fit for being put in the communal sleeping room anymore but are fine for K22.
- Bodhi made a new long term toilet paper storage in K22-2#, as this staircase-toilet already has a shelf. An additional short term storage (should last for a few months) still can be found in K20-1-1b.
- Janina would like to have a meeting with Isabel soon, possibly today to clarify the situation.
- The new old dish washer is working!
