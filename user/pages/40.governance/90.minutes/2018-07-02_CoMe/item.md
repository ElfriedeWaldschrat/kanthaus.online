Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- Janina made a new arrangement with Arjen that Villa Klug does all the Landgut Nemt pickups and calls us if it's a lot, so that we pick up from VK then.
- "We have edible leaves (in our man-made veggie beds) in our garden. I like to eat them very much. Sometimes drops of water land on them which are contaminated with bacteria and fungi which could potentially be harmful to my wolf body. I personally would like to be able to eat the edible leaves without having to worry about this issue." - Wolfi
  - Solution: we could use the green hose in the garden to water the plants instead of the water from the dumpster dived food
  - Tilmann: What to do with the dumpster food washing water? It was usually stored in buckets inside, but they make the Spülraum quite smelly. (I generally like the idea of collecting used water and reuse it, makes people more aware of how much they use)
- What about all the water from the washing machine? Should we just chuck it away?
  - We could water the lawn with it, the detergent shouldn't be a problem. Getting it out of the basement would be the bigger problem (Matthias)
  - But for the lawn we have enough dumpster water already, when we don't use it for flushing toilets and watering veggie beds (Wolfi)
  - Maybe we should just put it in the drain after all...
- Janina: Transfer people will start working here in August. We should make a plan to no become overwhelmed then.
- Janina: Kanthaus birthday on July 12th. An event on the website exists for 15:00. What should we do?
- Beer reserves: no changes to our drinking policy, but people drinking should be aware of the social effects. Beer cans should be cleaned up in time, not left standing around half-full and refrain from drinking at breakfast. A productive working atmosphere should be maintained most of the time.
- Matthias: Wants to get wandel würzen insurance as we are already doing kind of public events (~130€/year via Verband offener Werkstätten)
