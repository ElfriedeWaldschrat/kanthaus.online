### 6. Food planning
- Potatoes and onions in the basement need to be prepared. All long-lasting jars will be moved into the basement.

### 7. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- Matthias found Mehlmotten (flour moths) in the long-term food storage, some food has been removed as immediate measure, but needs thorough cleaning
- Hallway should get emptied today, and Dragon room within the next days. K22-1 Bathroom for silvans stuff
- Personal storage area could use some cleanup, people should be encouraged to move their stuff into boxes when they leave, even temporarily.
- About 150 EUR are missing from the money box between July 7th and July 30th. Should we take measures? -> better sheet, count fortnightly
- Kanthaus Blog could get some new posts! For example, food production topics, Auerworld review, Summer School/Klimacamp review? Janina will do one for the summer of karrot. Alex writes a post about fruit trees outside, some recipes. Kaja: Kvass
- room planning meeting end of august (Lise wrote some thoughts down, would be cool if others do the same in preparation for a meeting). Idea to get clearer vision of what to do with K22.
- We had email contact with a person wanting to come by at some time in August. They phrased their initial contact in a quite demanding way just notifying us of their arrival. After a host offer some days later than their planned arrival, they asked multiple times to come earlier still.
We want to carefully check our online documentation about the process to come here to fit our implemented process.
Still, we will reject the person for the earlier time frame, offering to come by at our offered date. Matthias takes care to answer.
- Toilet situation in K22: Regularly, the toilets don't get flushed. Matthias locked the K22-2 bathroom and puts the key in the K22-2 staircase behind the flat door. The K22-1 bathroom will be occupied as a storage room, making the toilet unusable.
