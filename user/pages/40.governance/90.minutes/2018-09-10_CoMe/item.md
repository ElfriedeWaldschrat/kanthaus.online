<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 7. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- Ban on accumulation of stuff for 1-2 months. suggestion: people are only alowed to pickup/bringt us things if at least 3 people (that are currently residing in house) are like "wuahhuwhhw yeeeaaaa we really need this!!" (Bodhi)
  - Proposal was in reaction to last house pickup, Bodhi has since found a lot of the stuff useful.
  - Proposal not adopted. Being generally critical of future pickups, and making pickupers responsible for stuff agreed.
- Proposal: use window holders, even if not windy at that moment. (Doug)
  - Agreed. Direct feedback encouraged.
- Proposal: agreement to keep k18 side of k20 entrance clear at all times. (Doug)
  - Agreed. "Don't leave stuff in the entrance. If you leave stuff in the entrance you are responsible to move it as soon as possible or when asked to."
  - Matthias interested to mark 'clean-zone' on floor.
- Toilet seat in k20-1# toilet is quite often wet... I don't like that very much -> please check and wipe with toilet paper :-) (Matthias)
  - Agreed.
- Calling mobile phones (German) from the landline is not free anymore, but 2.4ct/minute. For other rates check https://www.hotvoip.com/rates/calling-rates#/ German landlines are still free (Matthias)
