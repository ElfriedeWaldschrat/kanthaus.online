Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 2. Evaluations <!-- $ python3 ~/kanthaus-private/report_evaluation_statuses.py -->

### 3. Changes to Governance
-

### 4. Last week review
- Water (€4.5 per m³):

- Ukranian couchsurfers stayed for 2 nights
- Janina and Doug went to the "Stadtgespräch" on Tuesday
- Selina asked if she could host her event "Erfahrungsräume" here. They will probably stay in Svens garden to have more space for their two dogs, but use Kanthaus as base for computer work
- Janina published a new post about our pesto making sessions on the Kanthaus blog: https://kanthaus.online/blog/2018-06-18_coriander-pesto
- The Schuldnerberatung sent someone here to do Sozialstunden without our knowledge. Janina called them and declined, so it should not happen again.
- plants are growing nicely in the garden
- it got windy and cold outside
- A taxi driver showed up at 3am today looking for somebody to bring to the airport; nobody wanted to go so she left again confused

### 5. Schedule and commitments <!-- https://cloud.kanthaus.online/apps/calendar/ -->
- Monday (today):
  - Regionalwerkstatt: Janina
  - bring out black bin

- Wednesday:
  - Sharing event: maybe Isabel

  - Market pickup: Wolfi

  - CoMe Facilitator: (undecided)

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- A box will be picked up today by Hermes. Just hand it out to the guy, that's it. Bodhi and Silvan will be very thankful!
- Proposal: only continue to count the main water meter (Doug.) We don't do anything with the sub-meter data, and one of them goes backwards. Only counting the main meter reduces the workload by ~80% without any significant changes to our system.
  - Tilmann talked about automating it and adding it into grafana anyway. I guess that would only be the main counter?
  - Agreement.
- Proposal: indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space (Doug.) The pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Agreement
- Proposal: Adopt ISO 8601 whenever writing purely numeric dates (Doug.) https://xkcd.com/1179/ (e.g. 2018-06-22 or, if year unnecessary, 06-22)
  - Agreement
- Matthias would really like people / especially groups using K22 to clean it more (mainly toilets/bathrooms /bringing water again)
  - Make it more clear to people using it that it's harder to clean because of no running water/ no electricity
- Isabel wants to have a rent contract for moving here officially
  - Needs more research because it probably needs designated living room
  - Should talk to Richard from Attac Villa to ask about details
