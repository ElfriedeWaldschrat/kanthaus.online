Restmüll / Food waste
  - recap: Organic bin not in use anymore because of fruit fly situation.
  - currently, rest waste really smells because of the food waste in there (bread, cooked food)
  - Solution: ONLY SEALED JARS/CONTAINERS into any bin. Other things go on compost or separate sealed bucket that is to be stored in basement -> Awareness
