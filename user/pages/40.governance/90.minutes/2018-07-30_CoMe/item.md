Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 6. Food planning

-should collect some more food today, Janina is motivated
- more food should also arrive when Auerworld people get back? maybe check
- lots of apples, some plums, Nick would like to make a milky bread pudding cake
- the plums will autorefresh soon
- Tilmann will not be cooking this week, maybe at night
- Maybe the potatoes in the garden are ready to harvest? Bodhi is head of potatoes (can we harvest them without killing the plant)
- Pak choi, tomatoes, and cucumbers are ready to eat!
- Collecting seeds for Courgette/Tomatoes? Not entirely clear how to do it.
- So few people is easier to co-ordinate cooking

### 7. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
-Governance changes should be pushed - lots of topics have come up, should get organised, 3 gitlab issues or so, kanthaus.online has a branch of constitution changes to sort through - it's really a rationalization process and discussion, tomorrow after a nice  breakfast that we eat together like a proper family
- People chit-chatting in the common room in the morning, no/unclear rules about sleeping in the piano room noise, assumption was that it works like the communal sleeping room where silent talking is accepted
- Rainwater collecting things, blue tub, and bathtub, question around whether to keep the lids on them, and maybe making it clearer to others. It doesn't rain so much so not so much of a problem. Two considerations are: Evaporation? Mosquitoes? After some weeks mosquitos gather. So, overall keep it (the one next to the trash) open. Could also setup more rainwater collection. Arts and craft room? Activity planned. Not for this week. Maybe steal the bathtub from there. Add gitlab issue.
