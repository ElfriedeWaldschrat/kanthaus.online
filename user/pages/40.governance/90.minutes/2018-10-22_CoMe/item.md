<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 7. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- Freeshop box in communal closet is full. Please look into it before the end of the week, then we move it to the freeshop
- suggestion: clearing fridge/freezer and moving stuff to the hallway (Bodhi) -> fridge commitee formed! (Bodhi, Lise, Matthias) they will come to a decision. Everyone else is fine with this either way
- Doug wants to screen this one hour talk about why it's important to go to jail for the atmosphere, followed by discussion https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2VkC4SnwY0 Today at 21:30
- Transfer update (Matthias/Janina)
- Nancy might be interested in using a room to do a meetup for moms who are former drug addicts. Concerns providing a room? (matthias)
- Please don't put microfiber cloths into 90 degrees washing, normally max. 40, some allow 60 degrees (matthias)
- Idea of the Kanthaus game (matthias)
- Long wood at back of house seems to molding. Request for observations and/or proposals (Doug)
- Sven wants to know if we want to take two of his peach trees (and potentially more plants). This would need to happen before the frost, so ideally this week. We'd need to go there with the car and 2-3 people to get the trees out, put them in the car and plant them in our garden. Other people could have already prepared the holes to make it more efficient. We could also use the opportunity to bring stones to Sven's garden. (Janina)
- Can we have a scheduling session for events in December/January? There are some things and I would like to somehow get them in order to see if there would be time for a winter of Karrot in January. (Janina)
- how to attach signs to wooden things, sign commitee meeting? (Bodhi)
- Airbnb review/retrospective - not urgent, but should be done at some point (Tilmann)
  - According to Matthias, the account is half disabled and could be deleted
  - Our previous guest didn't reply again
- we will call Christian Kutz (talking about visiting us, book-thing, compost-toilet)

### 8. For next week
- Has Isabel returned second set of keys yet? (Doug) maybe use code instead of key if people are away for so long...
