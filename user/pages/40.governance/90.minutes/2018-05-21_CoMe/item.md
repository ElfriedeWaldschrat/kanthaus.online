### 5. Schedule <!-- Question: do we really need this section anymore? We have the Nextcloud Calendar and this seems like unnecessary duplication, especially since it's likely that more events come up during the meeting. I would propose to change this section just for week-commitments, e.g. who is doing the food pickups? Facilitating the Share Event? Facilitating the next CoMe? Etc -->
(For waste collection see https://cloud.kanthaus.online/apps/calendar/ 'müll' calender, for food pickups see https://foodsharing.de )

### 6. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- getting a water counter for K22 costs ~200€. Alternatively, we just connect it to the K20 water system. - Nobody is unhappy to buy a counter.
- getting smoke detectors will always be ~10€/detector (with a 10 year battery). Matthias suggests getting https://www.pearl.de/a-NX5663-3111.shtml?vid=917&wa_id=40&wa_num=4114&utm_source=googleps&utm_medium=cpc&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI796k9uuH2wIVCmQZCh1AzAVZEAkYCCABEgI7vvD_BwE is we want some. -  Doug will check it out.
  - Doug convinced that alarms which are only photoelectric are better: https://wahigroup.com/Resources/Documents/Ion%20vs%20Photo%20Smoke%20Alarms%20WAHI%20Conference%20Slides%20031415.pdf
- please always put full teapots on the small cupboard that also holds the tea - that way people know easily how much ready-made tea there is
- We can have almost boiling water coming out of the tabs right now, pleeeeease be careful! Doug will make signs. Tilmann is thinking about putting a Mischbatterie and points out that the hot water system is extremely temporary anyways...
- Having duplications with the Calendar and this template is not good. Starting next week we'll omit the schedule and only record commitments.

### 7. Next facilitator
- forgotten... -.- If nobody volunteers until next week Janina will do it again.
