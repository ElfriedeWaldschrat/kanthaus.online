<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 6. Food planning
- Schmorgurken would like to be prepared
- Doug did a mistake when he dumpsterwashed last week: He put food needing to be eaten soon in a bucket that was standing in the edge. For the future, just put fast-to-be-eaten-food into a small box into the kitchen.

### 7. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- The hallway has been really clear this week, yay :) Let's go even further with being non-blocking. (Doug)
- Proposal: close for visitors mid-Jan to mid-Feb for winter community and introspection. It's the coldest part of the year https://www.yr.no/place/Germany/Saxony/Wurzen/statistics.html and allows WuWiTa/NJ to hang around for a bit. (Doug). Slight Concern: University is going at these times. Other concern: If we are very little people and then close down that might also not be good.
- Frauke wishes to visit and do work experience, 11nov - 23nov (Doug)
- Schuhe im Flur: Es sind geade mega wenig Schlappen/Crocs/etc. im Flur, vorhin kein Paar. Wo sind die alle hin? Das ist mega unpraktisch, wenn man mal fix in den Keller/Garten möchte. Ich (Silvan) habe jetzt ein paar ausm Treppenhaus und ein Paar ausm Random Stuff Storage in den Flur gestellt. -> Bodhi glaubt daran mitschuld zu sein. Geschlossene (warme) hausschuhe sind auf dem Dachboden in der Schuhkiste.
- Wenn ihr Fotos im Zusammenhang mit dem Kanthaus macht, bitte speichert diese in der Cloud! (Es ist extrem nervig die verschiedenen Speicherorte ausfindig zu machen, wenn Fotos gesucht werden).
- (Freiwillige) Standupmeetings um 09:30 Uhr draußen im Garten. Alle sind eingeladen, den Tag zu planen.
- Bitte kein Holz/keine scharfen Gegenstände in den Geschirrspüler
- Der Siemens-Staubsauger gehört in das Kabuff hinter der Snackkitchen
