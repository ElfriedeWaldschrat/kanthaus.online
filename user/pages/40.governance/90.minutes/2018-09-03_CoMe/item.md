<!--
Hello facilitator/notary! Thank you for your services. Here is some advice for facilitating coordination meetings:
  - Prepare the meeting a bit beforehand (find out about evaluations, gas, electricity and water usages, waste collections, income, scheduled events). You can ask others to assist you.
  - Notify people 10 minutes before the meeting starts. (Watching the clock is not super fun, people will be grateful if you do it for them.)
  - Start at 10:00 sharp, or earlier if everyone is there. (Waiting is time-wasting, be a time-saver!)
  - If you don't want to take notes yourself ask someone else to take care of that. (This pad can easily be used to read from and write in simultaneously.)
  - Go through the ordered points in order, even if nothing has changed. (They are arranged to try and get the most relevant information to most people.)
  - Feel welcome to moderate conversation if off-topic or too detailed. (Are listeners interested? Are speakers satisfied? Can you identify a sub-group?)
  - Try to finish the meeting before 11:00. (There is always more to talk about and it's important for people to know that CoMes don't take forever.)
  - Leave the room once the meeting has ended. (This sends a clear signal to everyone else that they can also leave and get on with their day.)
  - Take care that the meeting minutes will be put to kanthaus.online. (If you don't know how to do it, ask someone to help you with it. But do it today!)
  - As soon as the minutes are online, empty the pad from all irrelevant things and get it ready for the next facilitator. (Only keep regular events such as CoMe, power hour, regular food pickups and such. Move the counter figures from 'last 7 days' to '7 days before that' and adjust the date to next week.)
  - Please indent list points with a double-space, not a tab-space: the pad has a bug when rendering markdown, adding extra lines. The resulting web-page looks spacey... not in a good way.
  - Have fun!

### 3. Changes to Governance
- Constitutional change round 1 is over! Some small errors in the proposals have already been detected again... -.- The idea is to maybe make it possible to make changes on formatting issues in-between the two voting rounds, while still counting the proposal as the same. (More discussion and maybe a meeting needed..?)
- It is not over yet, Bodhi can still vote today :-) https://ukuvota.world/#/app/bb17e32c-f33b-66af-b9f9-edac2bfed80a/vote
- Collective Agreements should be changed soon, so that we can add the host system and the check-in round. Will be discussed in #kanthaus-governance on Slack. Janina would be happy for someone pushing this! -> Doug and maybe Matthias and Lise are interested in pushing this

### 6. Food planning
- quite much short-lasting food from Villa Klug arrived, please eat!
- please do not give away any more onions! (at least not randomly during fair-teiler opening..) we dont have sooo many anymore and they are awesome to have :)

### 7. Discussion (e.g. questions, proposals, updates, requests, etc)
- Wenn Leute aus dem Dorm "ausziehen" sollten sie darauf hin gewiesen werden, dass die Betten nach einem Abziehen auch wieder frisch zu beziehen sind.
  - Tilmann will make a sign
- The Address book in our cloud has a lot more data. Check the data and add more, especially birth dates :)
- Grundstückverschmelzung: Seems to be the requirement to do anything that touches both buildings (e.g. Durchbruch) -  we would need to speak to the WGW regarding our Bauverpflichtung to either remove or change it - total cost in both cases would be approximately 200-400€. (Draft by matthias)
- Bodhi is looking for a box with camping stuff on the opposite side of the dishwasher (moved to the table in the random stuff storage)
- Estimation for making basement rooms drier/nice: ~35-50€/m² for flooring, ~20€/m² for walls; optional outside drainage when still to wet (~1.5k€ for the garden side); K20-big room: 30m² floor, 60m² walls -> 1500-2000 €
- Pass through heater for shower is broken :-( We don't know why. Solar energy shifted 100% to showers for now
- There's a proposal of adding a project gallery to Kanthaus home page, you can comment on the PR: https://github.com/kanthaus/kanthaus.online/pull/24 will merge tonight if there's no resistance (Tilmann)
- Car parking: there's no street cleaning in Schweizergartenstraße, so either park the car there or in front of our house if needed
- suggestion to show costs in CoMe as percentage of last week (matthias might think about a scripting approach)
- There is the idea of closing Kanthaus (somewhen in winter time) to do a governance hackathon and maybe more (e.g. handbook hackathon)
