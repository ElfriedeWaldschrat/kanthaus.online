### Coordination Meeting
We meet on Mondays at or before 10:00 to distribute information, make plans and generally coordinate. All residents are recommended to join.

### Power Hour
We meet on Thursdays at 10:00 to briefly review, prioritize, allocate communal cleaning tasks before splitting up and cleaning for the next hour. This is an addition to ordinary cleaning, not a replacement. All residents are recommended to join.

### Heart Sharing Circle
We usually meet on Wednesdays at 17:00 to share feelings in a safe space. There may or may not be a facilitator and if no group comes together to share, the circle does not happen. This event is completely optional, but the time slot is generally reserved for something related to emotional well-being and community maintenance.

### Host System & Check-In Round
Every Visitor needs a Volunteer/Member to act as their host. The host is taking care that the Visitor is as well integrated as possible and understands how Kanthaus works.<br>
Visitors are strongly recommended to ask for a check-in round after spending around ~7 days in the space, otherwise the host will arrange one. The check-in round is an informal chat about the relationship between Kanthaus, its residents and the Visitor. It is optional for Volunteers/Members, but the Visitor needs to attend.

### Quiet Hours
Between 00:00 and 7:00 people are expected to be quiet. This is especially relevant for spaces (near to) where people sleep: K20-2, K22-1 and K22-2. There may be exceptions to this general rule, but they need to be explicitly announced and agreed upon at least a day (24 hours) in advance.

### Clear Table Policy
Please help us keep commonly used tables as clear as possible. If you are done using a surface, please remove the things you were working with, so that the table can directly be used by the next person. This is especially relevant for the tables in K20-1 (Office, Kitchen, Snack Kitchen and Living Room).

### Clear Windowsill Policy
Every room needs at least one window that can be opened with no to minimal effort. That means that the windowsill needs to be clear by default.

### Smoking
Please do not smoke at all within the buildings. If you smoke outside, please ensure that smoke does not come in through open doors or windows. Do not throw cigarette butts on the ground! They can be disposed of in the black bin in the garden.

### Drinking
The space is not a bar: please do not come here with drinking as a primary purpose and be aware that alcohol consumption will not be considered as an excuse or justification of behavior. That said, individuals may responsibly consume alcohol in the space. Please contact a Volunteer or Member with concerns or questions regarding this topic.

### Animals
The space is not very safe right now, making generally unsuitable for animals. Even if it was safe, animals are not necessarily welcome due to factors such as: allergic reactions, hair-shedding, defecation, damage to resources, biting and other undesirable behaviors. Potential animal residents will be considered on a case by case basis. Please contact a Member to discuss bringing an animal.

### Casual Mode
If there are not more than 5 residents at a given time, all rules recorded in this document, except the ones about smoking, drinking and animals, are relaxed. The people are expected to talk to each other and are explicitly encouraged to find custom solutions for everything that seems overly regulated for a group that small.

### Changes to the Collective Agreements
Any addition, subtraction or other change to this document should be made according to the [Constitution](../constitution#collagrchange).
