<p>Please try to leave the battery <em>fully</em> charged at all times!</p>
<h2 id="detecting-charging-state-of-the-battery">Detecting charging state of the battery</h2>
<p>The battery is (nearly) fully charged when one of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voltage above 14.0 V AND current below 3 A</li>
<li>Voltage above 13.5 V AND current below 1 A</li>
</ul>
<p>When it is dark and only little power (e.g. 1 light) is drawn, the charging state is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly full: Voltage &gt; 12.6 V</li>
<li>Half empty: Voltage ~ 12.1 V</li>
<li>STOP USAGE: Voltage ~ 11.7 V</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-is-the-lifetime-of-these-batteries">How is the lifetime of these batteries?</h2>
<p>Lead acid batteries like these ones here take damage from</p>
<ul>
<li>Not beeing fully charged: Leave it standing empty for a year and you can throw it away. Interpolation (regarding state-of-charge as well as time) can be done lineary :)</li>
<li>Being cycled/used: This is a bit harder.
<ul>
<li>Do full-cycles (Charge fully/discharge fully) and you can throw it away after 10-20 cycles.</li>
<li>Do half-cycles (Charge fully, discharge down to 50%/12V) and you can throw it away after 50-100 full cycles (translating to 100-200 of these half-cycles).</li>
<li>Do smaller cycles (charge fully, discharge only 5-10%) and it will last for thousands of these (typical use case in car)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
