_*We can charge Thinkpads easily, both old (barrel-type) and new (rectangle-type) sockets. We can charge other laptops, if: (1) you bring the corresponding 12 V DC (car) charger, or (2) your laptop takes 20 V DC and you're happy for us to perform some minor surgery on your regular charger, or (3) your AC Adapter works with 80V DC (Macs do) and the sun is shining.
