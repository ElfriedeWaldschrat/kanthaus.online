# People
- interested in doing work on the house (construction, maintainance)
- interested in participating in existing projects (foodsharing, Repair-Café)
- interested in creating their own projects in/with the house (trying to incorporate the public)

# Things that are needed:

By our vision we try to reuse material that is not needed (e.g. bought too much, just lying around) or not wanted (e.g. optical problems, need some repair work, outdated) where it currently is.
We need to do some general maintenance and renovation work on the house as well as material and tools to start projects.

- A 2-4m ladder
- modern windows, multiple of same size (to exchange some/all windows of the house)
- Rooftop material for 300m² (We want to redo the rooftop in 1-2 years - preferably no bitumen)
- humidity isolation for outside walls
- thermal isolation for roof

### Workshop equipment:
- Hammer drill machine (SDS)
