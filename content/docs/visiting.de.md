_*We can charge Thinkpads easily, both old (barrel-type) and new (rectangle-type) sockets. We can charge other laptops, if: (1) you bring the corresponding 12 V DC (car) charger, or (2) your laptop takes 20 V DC and you're happy for us to perform some minor surgery on your regular charger, or (3) your AC Adapter works with 80V DC (Macs do) and the sun is shining. Laptops can also be charged at the nearby library during [opening hours](http://www.kultur-in-wurzen.de/index.php/startseite-bibliothek/bibliothek-angebot)._
