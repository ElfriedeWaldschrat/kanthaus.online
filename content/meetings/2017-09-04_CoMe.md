	- paragraphes about awareness and ressources [Laurina]
	- *Awareness:* we want to regulate only where needed and promote a culture of awareness. 
	- For us this means thinking, watching and/or asking before acting and considering the effects of our actions carefully.
	- Be aware of the effect of your behaviour (might) have also on the other individualsin the house and what the need.
    - *Ressources* (e.g. food, toiletries): Countless amounts of ressources in Germany go to waste. 
    - At least a third of all food in Gemany gets thrown away. 
    - We want to prevent waste and wasteful behavior and therefore try to work mostly with ressources that otherwise would have been thrown away. 
    - For example our food, toiletries, alcohol and furniture are saved. 
    - Please be aware of how much there is and that other people also want to enjoy the ressources. 
    - Food is dumpsterdived or from foodsharing. Most of the rest is saved at festivals or from individuals.
